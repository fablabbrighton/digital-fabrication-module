How the course is assessed; what you need to submit

<!--more-->

## Deliverables

### Portfolio

**80% of the mark**

*A digital porfolio which compiles evidence of the learning that takes place through the projects.*

You will be assessed on what you document in your portfolio, not what you make. While it will be more rewarding and fun if you succeed in all the tasks, you don't need to do this to get a great mark. The aim of the documentation is to help you develop a useful skill in technical practice: doing experiments, trying techniques, recording the process: what works, what could be improved and how you have succeeded or failed at each stage. If you consider all of your experiments failures, but you record the process well, you can get a great mark. If you breeze through and find all the techniques easy, you will have to challenge yourself to find new limits in order to have somethng to document.

Your blog should have: 
* one page about yourself and your aims for the course
* one page or more for each assignment
* several pages detailing your project
* one page for your reflective statement

Please ensure your page titles clearly reflect these areas so the assessors are able to understand your submission easily.

When documenting assignments and project work, make sure you include:

* A concise articulate description of what you are doing / have done, step by step
* Photos, screesnshots or videos to illustrate key steps, results or setups
* Settings you've used for machines or mix proportions
* Details of problems, mistakes and how you dealt with them (this is **very important**)
* Details of the final result, including clear photography
* Details of the stages you went through to get to your final result: what did you change, test, improve, revisit, etc.
* Digital files such as vector artwork or 3D CAD files


### Reflective Statement

**20% of the mark**

*A 500 word critical reflective statement.*

This is not the place to make a case for how good your work is! The assessors want to see that you have been critical and reflective. You should make note of:

* Processes, tools, topics you found difficult, frustrating, inefficient etc. and how you tried to overcome these obstacles.
* How you felt your work improved, and where it still be improved. What are the new horizons you've reached?
* Your thoughts on the methods and approaches covered in the course: where do they work well, where are they lacking, what do you see as the opportunity for these tools.

It is your job to ensure you are able to submit before the deadline. 

Finalising your work, checking for technical errors such as missing images, and creating a PDF of your website may take some time, so make sure you are able to do this in time.

Any technical questions with Edublogs should be directed to IT support; make sure you allow enough time for any issues to be resolved.
