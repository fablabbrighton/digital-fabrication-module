Bringing everything together into a final project

<!--more-->

## Prep for this week's class

You should have attended all previous lessons and completed all assignments. 
You can use time in these weeks to complete assignments, but you will also need this time to work on your project – you will have to find extra time to work independently.


## Assignment

Develop, plan and execute a final project that integrates skills, tools and processes from across the module.

Document all your work on your student blog, showing your progress each week (1 week per page for 4 weeks minumum).


### What do I need to do to pass? (40%) :construction:



Your project should be a physical thing that shows off your skills using digital fabrication methods, including any of:
* 2D and 3D design software
* 2D fabrication tools such as the laser cutter or milling machine
* 3D fabrication tools such as the 3D printer or milling machine
* Interactive technology or electronics such as lights, sensors, Arduinos or microcontrollers.

Include a page on your original project proposal including sketches, diagrams, mood boards or examples of similar work.

Include a page on the end result with photographs of the final project, a description of what it is/does and a reflection on how it could be improved.






with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. Cite external sources where you have used someone else's work.

### Extra credit (50-100%) :construction:

Integrate more technologies to a greater degree of sophistication

Show how prototyping has helped you develop a better final project

Include videos, timelapses or other rich media to show off your final project or its development
