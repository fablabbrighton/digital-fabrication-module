## Project Ideas

Search the Fab Academy project archive: <http://fabacademy.org/2019/>  
Use the Google custom search at the bottom of the page.

Instructables - loads of great project ideas: <https://www.instructables.com/>

A collaborative list of "Making and Prototyping Resources for Designers" here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9LTUSnsCzg3ukG-GRQVC3w-OHYxJg1u88qn6yv2NTU/edit#heading=h.m6m64wyno28o

> How can design students make their work without access to university facilities such as workshops, fablabs, simulation suites, computer labs and technical support.


## Basic materials and suppliers

If you can spend a little money, it's easy to get electronics prototyping materials online:


### Microbit
Microbit authorised retailers: https://microbit.org/buy/?country=GB (I recommend Pimoroni). Or look for cheap ones on eBay – £7-15

### Microbit plus some simple electronics in a kit
https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/1877030 – £32

https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/micro-bit-complete-starter-kit – £38

https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5618-bbc-microbit-with-inventors-kit-and-accessories.html – £40

### Microbit plus separate electronics kit (Microbit not included)
https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/elecfreaks-tinker-kit-for-bbc-micro-bit-micro-bit-not-included – £38

https://www.kitronik.co.uk/c5603-inventors-kit-for-the-bbc-microbit.html – £25


### Arduino Uno (clone, board only, £10) 
https://www.amazon.co.uk/ELEGOO-Board-ATmega328P-ATMEGA16U2-Cable/dp/B01EWOE0UU/

### Arduino Uno Small Kit (clone, £14): https://www.amazon.co.uk/ELEGOO-Starter-Tutorial-Compatible-Official/dp/B01DGD2GAO/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=arduino&qid=1581095802&sr=8-15

Arduino Uno Larger Kit (clone, £28, includes many more inputs and outputs): https://www.amazon.co.uk/UNIROI-Arduino-Breadboard-Upgraded-Tutorials/dp/B07D8MZJX4/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=arduino&qid=1581095802&sr=8-19


## Online simulators

Free (but I only recommend as a last resort, as your projects will be very limited (and it’s not as much fun!)

## CAD, rendering and CAM

You may not be able to print your model, but you can model it in 3D, and create toolpaths or beautiful renders in Fusion 360.

## Project examples


### Capacitative touch sensing with pencil and paper
Using simple materials to enable remarkably sophisticated interactions:  https://www.instructables.com/id/Turn-a-pencil-drawing-into-a-capacitive-sensor-for/

### Cardboard prototyping
You should be doing this anyway! Before making a 3D printed enclosure for your project, make a prototype out of carboard. Some fine techniques here: http://www.judepullen.com/designmodelling/

### Soft circuits
Huge collection of great electronics + textiles projects here, including many inspiring technique explorations. 100% recommended!

### Hi-lo tech
> High-Low Tech was a research group at the MIT Media Lab from 2009-2014. HLT's work integrates high and low technological materials, processes, and cultures. Our primary aim is to engage diverse audiences in designing and building their own technologies by situating computation in new cultural and material contexts, and by developing tools that democratize engineering.

And if you're serious, here: https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/
> The Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) is a modular, DIY, low-cost, high-performance platform that allows for the easy fabrication of the 50 different Industrial Machines that it takes to build a small, sustainable civilization with modern comforts. We’re developing open source industrial machines that can be made at a fraction of commercial costs, and sharing our designs online for free.
