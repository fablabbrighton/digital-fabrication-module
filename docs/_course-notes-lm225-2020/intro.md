## Prep for this week

### Your presentation



### Your computer with software

It will be very helpful to have a **laptop** you can bring to the class. There are some desktop PCs available, but you will find it a lot more difficult to work. 

We will be using a lot of new software. **You must install and verify software before coming to the lectures.** Some software requires a free educational licence, which may take some time to be provided. Minimum requirements:

* 2D: Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator
* 3D: Autodesk Fusion 360, Ultimaker Cura
* Web publishing: :construction:

Helpful: 
* Image editor: Adobe Photoshop
* Video editor (Premiere, iMovie, Final Cut Pro, etc.)
* Photo editor that offers compression settings (Apple Photos, Adobe Photoshop)



## Digital Fabrication

What is it
Interesting examples
Culture and technology

Inspire students/frame course in terms of outcomes
This is how you can apply this:
 - 3d fabrics that bend with water or 3D printed parts
 - defensive clothing that inflates etc
 - see FA archives for textiles projects (or fabricademy)	


### The course

Aims
Difficulty
Time/Project management

Co-ordinating between yourselves, time in the lab (can take a machine 2 hours to do something)
Catch-up weeks

### The lab

Tour!

* Machines
* Materials
* What you can make

### Content overview

See: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes-lm225-2020/handbook#overall-course-structure>

## Introductions :construction:

Max 3 mins each

* Tell us who you are, and what you're interested in making (in this module or more broadly)
* Show something you've made (on your course, or not), and talk about how and why you made it


Inc me!

## Assessment
:construction:

Philosophy of documentation
"Document all your work on your student blog, with photos and videos to show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it. Cite external sources where you have used someone else’s work."


Not what you make, but how you document

Lab notes, not a report for me (a bit artificial) but I try to align what you need to get a good grade, with what is useful for you



Questions?



## Equipment and software

See handbook
Maybe recap on their access - do they have comuting labs at GP they can use?

## Documenting your work
:construction:

### Website architectures

CMS
Self-hosting: domains
HTML
Flat file sites
Platforms
Embedding media

The open web
Owning your stuff

Software

Text editor
CMS



Product photography

Compression





## Assignment
Build a website for the module
Include a page about yourself that covers the material of your presentation
Include a photo of yourself and the thing you've already made
Add a page for this week and cover what you've learned about publishing on the web: show what you did, what went wrong, and how you fixed it.

Submit the URL to Student Central

### What do I need to do to pass? (40%)

:speech_balloon: Explain these grade boundaries

* A working website with: 
  * An 'about' page 
  * A page for this week


### Extra credit (50-100%)

* If you're using Edublogs, customise the site design
* Review and test alternative platforms: document how you choose a platofrm to use
* Use an external hosting service that will serve you throughout your studies and into professional life
* Register a domain and point it to your site
