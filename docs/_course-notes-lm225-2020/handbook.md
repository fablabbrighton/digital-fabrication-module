## Aims
This module aims to provide students with a practical, hands-on introduction to a range of digital fabrication technologies.

## Learning outcomes

* LO1: Demonstrate a broad, critical understanding of a range of digital fabrication technologies and their underlying theories.
* LO2: Apply a range of digital fabrication technologies appropriately to a series of design related projects.
* LO3: Plan and critically evaluate projects using appropriate project management tools.
* LO4: Document technical design projects through a coherent digital portfolio of evidence.

## Teaching and learning activities

Students will be supported during a series of short, hands-on, practical design projects, through a series of weekly sessions which will include lectures, demonstrations, tutorials and workshops. Formative feedback will be delivered through peer and tutor evaluation after selected exercises.

A larger integrated project at the end which will be supported through tutorial sessions and through the online digital fabrication community.

The module uses a blended learning approach, including hands-on activities with face to face support and provided online resources. 

## Approach and background


A Fab Lab, or digital fabrication laboratory, is a place to play, to create, to mentor and to invent: a place for learning and innovation.
Fab Labs provide access to the environment, the skills, the materials and the advanced technology to allow anyone anywhere to make (almost) anything.





Overcoming difficulties
How to get over technical problems - that’s 50% of DFM!


Expectation that digital things just work even the name 3d printer is misleading
Don’t come in with the expectation that things will just work
It is as messy and and hands-on as any craft process



Preparing for sessions
Reading/watching videos
Time expectations
Student helper time in lab
Coming in Tuesday mornings

## Overall course structure


General format

Tuesday pm
1 hour lecture
2 hours guided making / tutorials

Rest of the week
Independent study



## Study hours

This is a 20 credit module. You are expected to spend about 200 hours studying on this course. This includes the time that you will spend copiling your portfolio for assessment, which is a continuous process throughout the course. 

All students are expected to undertake guided independent study, which includes wider reading/practice, follow-up work, the completion of assessment tasks, and revisions. 

The course spans 15 weeks (including assessment and feedback) = 13-14 hours/week study time.  
There are 3 hours of teaching time per week, so you should plan to spend about **10 hours/week** studying independently.

In order to get the most from each week's teaching session, you will be expected to prepare in advance, for example, by installing and testing software, watching instructional videos, and preparing the groundwork to learn new topics. The course notes for each week include instructions on any prep you must do, and suggestions for resources you can review.


## Assessment 

Students will compile a digital portfolio to evidence the learning that takes place during these projects.

There are two types of assessment you need to be aware of – Formative and Summative
 
**Formative Assessment**: takes place throughout the module through discussion and feedback from peers and your tutor on your work-in-progress. It does not contribute to the final mark of the module but instead supports the development of learning and prepares for summative assessment. Formative assessment will help you to identify what is good in your work and how to improve your work. Formative assessment is typically but not exclusively linked to the learning outcomes of the module.
 
 
**Summative Assessment**: takes place at the end of the module. During summative assessment your tutor will formally assess the work you have submited. 
 

### Tasks
 
1. Produce a digital porfolio which compiles evidence of the learning that takes place through the projects. It is expected that compiling this digital portfolio will take approximately 35 hours 80% (LO1, LO2, LO4). The volume of the portfolio is to be agreed in consultation with the module tutor. The framework for its content is determined through formative assessment, whilst the independent study hours of the module will be indicative of student effort.

2. 500 word critical reflective statement 20% (LO3)

## Things you will need

### A laptop capable of running design software. 

A netbook or tablet may be fine for taking notes and working on your documentation, but most of the tasks involve software which will only run on 'real' computer. For reference, my 2013 MacBook works fine – you don't need anything high-end.

There are some computers in the lab, but access is limited, so you will find it much easier if you bring your own computer.


### Software

* Adobe [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/buy/students.html) (student discount) or Inkscape (free, open-source) (or other 2D vector software such as Affinity Designer)
* Adobe [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/buy/students.html) (student discount) or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) (free, open-source) (or other image editor: e.g. Pixelmater, Acorn on Mac, many more on Windows)
* Simple photo editing software – e.g. Apple/Windows Photos (free)
* Simple video editing software – e.g. Free: iMovie, Windows Movie Maker. Paid: Final Cut Pro,  Adobe Lightroom
* [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) (free for education use)
* [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) (free)
* Google Chrome or Safari for running web-based tools
* An app for taking notes: Apple Notes, Evernote, Microsoft OneNote, or many others (Try a few out, and find one that suits your working style. You will need to take notes quickly and easily, so get comfortable with this tool.)
* Screenshot / screencapture tool (these are built into macOS and Windows. Find out how to use them.)

### Equipment

* Camera or smartphone (taking good photos is essential; bring the best camera you can)
* Sketchbook and drawing tools


## Where to find information

All the course content and supporting information is in the Github repository here:
<https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module/tree/master/docs/_course-notes-lm225-2020>

That same content is published here: <https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/>

Don't know what Github is? Find out here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E>

Github is typical of the sort of tools we'll be using throughout the module: based on open source tools that anyone can use or modify; built by and for its users; part of a globally connected comminity of people making tools to make things.

#### Learning technical skills

We'll be covering **a lot** of new ground. There is far more to learn than can be covered in the lecture time available. Fortunately, there are many resources to help you.

* LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com) has many courses including introductions to all the software packages we're using. You can access these free with a student account. I strongly recommend watching some of these before each session.
* YouTube tutorials (a great resource, especially for Arduino and electronics).
* [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org) (this course is based on Fab Academy. Many of the lectures are derived from very similar ones, all available online here: [videos](https://vimeopro.com/academany/fab-2019), [notes](http://fabacademy.org/2019/schedule.html)).
