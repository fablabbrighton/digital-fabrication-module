Reviewing progress so far.

## Prep for this week's class

**The deadline for formative assessment is: 10am, Monday 30 March**

Ensure your assigments for prior weeks are complete and published to your blog
Come prepared to present your work to the class

Make an initial plan for a project you'd like to work on, that you can share with the class:

* What is it?
* Why is it interesting?
* How might you make it?
* What are you unsure about; what do you think you might need help with?

From <http://howtocrit.com>: 

> As the person getting a crit, you have a lot of responsibility for making the process valuable. Make sure that you are prepared to ask pointed, specific questions about your work — know what you want answers to, and be able to clearly ask questions that will get you those answers. Think about what you want to get out of the crit, and have a written list of questions with you. Generic questions like “what do you think?” are not very useful.

## For next week

Over Easter, research your final project:

* How could you make it?
* Sketch out ideas, look for inspiration from other projects, compile a mood board or list of references 
* Do you need any special materials or parts that you need to source in advance?
* Are there any skills you need to start learning now?

You should be ready to start making (or have already started) by the time you come back after Easter.
